Alessandro Pellegrini personal webpage
======================================

This is my personal website.

Dependencies
------------

You need `jekyll` and `jekyll-scholar` to generate the site.
Both can be instaled from the ruby `gem` installer as:

`gem install jekyll`    
`gem install jekyll-scholar`
`gem install jekyll-last-modified-at`

You need to have the local `~./gem/ruby/{VERSION}/bin` folder in your path to be able to run the installed software.

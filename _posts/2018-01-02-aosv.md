Course Objectives and Exam Rules
--------------------------------

The *Advanced Operating Systems and Virtualization* course (6 CFU) aims at presenting advanced design/implementation methods and techniques for modern Operating Systems, including the support for system virtualization, and several security aspects. 
The topics dealt with in the course are bound to case studies oriented to Linux systems and x86 processors. During the course, we will see the internals from Linux 2.4, 2.6, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0.

The course requires basic knowledge of the organisation and services offered by modern Operating Systems, of data structures, and of C/assembly programming. Some insights on the x86 computing architectures will help at bootstrapping the new topics shown in the course. 

The exam consists of a written test and a practical project. The project requires the student to develop some new services within the Linux kernel.     
Instructions for project assignment will be given during the lectures.

After a student has passed the written test, a one-year grace period to hand off the project is granted. The final mark is the weighted average of the scores obtained at the written test and at the project. The written test is worth 3/5 of the final mark, while the project is worth 2/5 of the final mark.
Rejecting the final mark is possible, but requires the student to pass the written test again and hand over a different project.

**Important Notice**: On this page, I provide references and links to help the students *increase* their undesrtanding on the topics covered in this course. <u>No unique handbook</u> exists which covers all the presented topics. I hope this is an added value for the course, rather than a limitation. You can come to office hours to discuss about your doubts and to ask for clarifications.
